## Description

A video player that allows a user to play videos in the browser. When the user clicks the play button the video begins to play, the play icon changes to a pause icon and the time starts to increase along with the progress bar. When the user clicks on the pause icon the video will pause, the icon changes to the play icon and the progress bar and timer stop. The user can seek for a specific point in the video by scrubbing the progress bar. The user can change the volume of the video by scrubbing the volume slider and the user can mute/unmute the video by clicking on the speaker icon. The user can toggle fullscreen mode by clicking on the fullscreen toggle icon.
